This is tar_indexer repository. 
using sqlite3 for index storing and allowing indexing of multiple tar archives. Beside that

Note, only raw (uncompressed) tar files are accepted as native tar.gz can not be random accessed. But you can compress each file using zlib before adding it to tar. 

#index content of multiple tar archives
tar2index.py -v -i db_*/*.tar -d archives.db3

#search for some_file in mutliple arhcives
tar2index.py -v -f some_file -d archives.db3
